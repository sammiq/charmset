Introduction
------------

[Hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/) is a matcher framework that is expressive and is used heavily by many test frameworks in various programming languages.

_Hamcrest_ is named for being an anagram of _matchers_ apparently; so is _charmset_ and is a good a reason to name it that as anything else.

Having liked this style of assertion for readability, and realized there is no canonical Go version, I looked around the community for something similar and for one reason or another decided that I would roll my own.

You probably don't want to look at this at the moment:

- It is not well-documented at all
- It is mostly for my personal use and suits my personal tastes
- The APIs are prone to change / breakage until I get happy with it
- I am not a Go expert, there are possibly many dumb things in here
